## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following components:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts input tokens into dense vectors.
- **Multi-Head Attention Layers**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- **Feedforward Neural Network Layers**: Applies a non-linear transformation to the output of the attention layers.
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes the output of each layer to stabilize training.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevents overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final predictions.

## Model Hyperparameters

- **Vocabulary Size**: The size of the tokenizer's vocabulary.
- **d_model**: The dimensionality of the embedding space (set to 768).
- **num_heads**: The number of attention heads (set to 12).
- **num_layers**: The number of layers in the model (set to 12).
- **dim_feedforward**: The dimensionality of the feedforward network (set to 3072).
- **dropout_rate**: The dropout rate (set to 0.1).

## Capabilities

The Transformer model can be used for various natural language processing tasks, including but not limited to:

- **Text Classification**: Classifying text into predefined categories.
- **Text Generation**: Generating coherent text based on input prompts.
- **Question Answering**: Providing answers to questions based on context.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of a given text.

## Usage

### Loading the Model

To load the trained model, use the following code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize the model
model = TransformerModel(vocab_size, d_model, num_heads, num_layers, dim_feedforward, dropout_rate)

# Load weights
model.load_weights("CACHE_DIRECTORY_PLACEHOLDER\\copamoody_model.h5")
Preparing Input Data
To prepare input data for the model, use the encode_examples function provided in the code. This function tokenizes the input text and creates attention masks.

Training the Model
The model can be trained using the fit method:

python

model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=val_dataset, epochs=3)
Saving the Model
After training, the model can be saved using:

python

model.save_weights("CACHE_DIRECTORY_PLACEHOLDER\\copamoody_model.h5")
Conclusion
This Transformer model provides a robust framework for various NLP tasks. By leveraging the power of attention mechanisms and deep learning, it can achieve state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks
